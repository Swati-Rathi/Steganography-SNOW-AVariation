<h1>Motivation- By Robin Sharma</h1>
<h3><p>Big question for you: what are you doing to help build a new and better world? Dont blame the politicians. Dont blame those around you. Dont blame your parents or your background. Doing so is playing the victim and this world has far too many people playing the victim when they could be shining and making a profound difference. Mother Teresa said it so much better than I ever could: if each of us would only sweep their own doorstep, the whole world would be clean. Nice.</p>

<p>Blaming others is excusing yourself. Telling yourself that you as an army of one cannot have an impact is giving away your power. A couple of college kids got their hands on empty school buses and drove them into New Orleans when everybody else said the city was unapproachable. A little man in a loincloth named Mohandas Gandhi freed an entire nation. A college student named Richard Branson took some initiative to start a record label on a shoestring that has since morphed into the Virgin empire. You are no different from them. We are all flesh and bones cut from the same cloth.</p>

<p>In a recent issue of Vanity Fair, Jennifer Aniston said that she gives herself one day to play victim after a challenging event. After that day of feeling sorry for herself and powerless, she wakes up and takes ownership over the way her life looks. And if she doesnt like a piece of it she sets about to change it. Thats personal leadership.</p>

<p>What dont you like about your life or the organization you work for or the country you live in? Make a list. Write it down. Shout it out. And then do something to improve things. Anything. Start small or go big. Just do something. Today. Now. The world will be better for it.</p></h3>
