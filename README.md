# Steganography-SNOW-AVariation
It is an innovative steganography technique which can be used to hide textual data behind the blankspaces between 2 words. It is a variation of the popular steganography tool - SNOW[Steganographic Nature Of Whitespace] developed by Matthew Kwan who used to hide the ASCII data behind the trailing whitespaces using 'space' and 'tab' keys.
