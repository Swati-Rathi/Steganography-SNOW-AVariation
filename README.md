# Steganography-SNOW-AVariation
It is an innovative steganography technique which can be used to hide textual data behind the blankspaces between 2 words. It is a variation of the popular steganography tool - SNOW[Steganographic Nature Of Whitespace] developed by Matthew Kwan who used to hide the ASCII data behind the trailing whitespaces using 'space' and 'tab' keys.
- File description:
- motivation2.txt: file on which the message to be hidden is overlayed.
- Sender.py: overlays the message on motivation2.txt and generates a carrier file out2.html.
- out2.html: Carrier file
- Receiver.py: It takes the carrier file out2.html reads it, and prints decoded message on the screen.
